# Column indices for data file, in the order: ID, age, delta age, intensity, delta intensity, data type, age distribution, stratification
# where column 0 is the first, column 1 is the second etc.
#
# Data type:  If data type is not specified as column data, set this parameter to -1. All data will be assigned a type "O" (other).
# 
# Age distribution of data: If age distribution is globally specified (and is not specified by column data):
#  -1 is uniform (with centre point given by the read age, and half-width given by the read delta age)
#  -2 is normal distribution (with mean given by the read age, and standard deviation given by delta age)
#
# Stratification: the column containing stratification information (in the column data: 0 is unstratified, non zero indicates stratification). 
# To ignore stratification, set the stratification parameter to -1
